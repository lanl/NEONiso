\title{NEONiso: Tools to Calibrate and Work with NEON Atmospheric Isotope Data}
\description{
Functions for downloading, calibrating, and analyzing atmospheric isotope data bundled into the eddy covariance data products of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) \url{https://www.neonscience.org}. Calibration tools are provided for carbon and water isotope products. Carbon isotope calibration details are found in Fiorella et al. (2021) \doi{10.1029/2020JG005862}, and the readme file at \url{https://github.com/lanl/NEONiso}. Tools for calibrating water isotope products have been added as of 0.6.0, but have known deficiencies and should be considered experimental and unsupported.
