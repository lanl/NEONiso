Maintainer: Rich Fiorella <rfiorella@lanl.gov>
Depends: 
    R (>= 4.0.0)
Description: Functions for downloading,
    calibrating, and analyzing atmospheric isotope data bundled
    into the eddy covariance data products of the National Ecological
    Observatory Network (NEON) <https://www.neonscience.org>. 
    Calibration tools are provided for carbon and water isotope products.
    Carbon isotope calibration details are found in Fiorella et al. (2021)
    <doi:10.1029/2020JG005862>, and the readme 
    file at <https://github.com/lanl/NEONiso>. Tools for calibrating water 
    isotope products have been added as of 0.6.0, but have known deficiencies
    and should be considered experimental and unsupported.
